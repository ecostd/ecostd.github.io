[.has-text-weight-bold.is-underlined]#Moderation#

If you feel that a thread in any of the GitHub repositories or other community
channels needs moderation, please contact the moderation team.

. Remarks that are contrary to the code of ethics, of any form, are not allowed
  in any of the various communications channels of the community.

. The code of ethics is only a guideline as to what is acceptable or not.

. Moderators can deem remarks not explicitly listed as unacceptably violating
  the spirit of the community standards.

. It is expected that the whole of the community cooperate in maintaining the
  standards.

. Although the actions taken by moderators in response to reports of violations
  are not fixed they can include: a factual investigation; warnings; private
  negotiation of a resolution (which may include an apology, probation,
  and/or access restrictions); warnings; temporary restrictions; and extended
  sanctions.

. If you think a moderation action was unjustified attempt to resolve it with
  the moderators first. And if unsuccessful contact the EcoStd owners for
  possible further actions.

. Individual moderators that has a conflict of interest in a complaint will not
  participate in the handling of the complaint.
